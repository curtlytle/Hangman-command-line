TO run, type "node main"

- All words are just one word, they are not phrases.
- It does not ignore capitization.  So if you choose 'a' and the word is Apple, it will not find it.
- It only does one word per node run, but it's random each run.
- If you loose, it gives you the chance to keep playing to try and guess the word.
- It'll tell you if have already guessed a letter, and won't count that against you.
